# cpnt201-a3
real cool repository for real cool svg assignment!!!

This is the third assignment for the course called CPNT 201 which is for a place called SAIT.  The assignment is named Assignment 3 - SVG Graphic.  
It was kind of hard to do this as I am not the best at drawing things so my SVG which is a dog was inspired by every abstract artist ever.  It is pretty obvious what it is because it's the only thing on the page other than the heading.  The graphic changes colours when the screen size gets smaller courtesy of media queries.
the link to the page for this is: https://lkruger93.github.io/cpnt201-a3/
I hope everyone likes my abstract dog.
